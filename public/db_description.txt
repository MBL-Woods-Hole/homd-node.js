HOMD Database Architecture


The HOMD frontend code is based on open-source Node.js (a server-side 
JavaScript runtime environment) 
and Express.js, a web application framework and runs on top of Node.js.

The HOMD database backend is based on MySQL and uses InnoDB tables for its data.
Database rules:
-Focus on trying to mimimize redundancy.
-Maximize speed of queries.
-Each table is linked to other tables by either the HMT-ID, or GENOME-ID
   and the table are indexed which allows faster queries.

One important point related to the database is that certain information
is queried from the database and placed in JSON format in flat files
for the Node.js server to read on startup.
This means the data is available in memory and much faster to access
than sql queries called during normal page loading.


The database is divided into four general sections:
Taxonomy, Genomes, Phage and Annotation tables
