Overview:  Members of genus Treponema are abundant in subgingival plaque and samples from the palatine tonsils, with lower amounts detected in supragingival plaque. Most oral treponemes are strict anaerobes; T. pallidum, which causes systemic disease, is microaerophilic (Baseman et al. 1976). 
Ecological role/importance in health and disease: Treponema are associated with periodontal disease. T. denticola, together with Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia, is part of the “red complex” of subgingival taxa associated with periodontitis (Socransky et al. 1998). T. pallidum is a human pathogen included in HOMD as a reference sequence even though it is not generally detected in the mouth.
