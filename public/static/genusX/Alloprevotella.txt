Overview: The genus Alloprevotella was split from its close relative, Prevotella, in 2013 (Downes et al. 2013). There are two named species, A. rava and A. tannerae, both found in the human mouth, and five unnamed human microbial taxa listed in eHOMD. 
Ecological role/importance in health and disease: Alloprevotella tannerae is detected primarily in subgingival plaque and on the tonsils and A. rava on the throat and tonsils. The unnamed Alloprevotella sp. HMT 473 is abundant on the keratinized gingiva, while A. spp. HMT 308 and 914 live primarily on the tongue, tonsils, and throat. The other unnamed species are detected only in very low abundance.
