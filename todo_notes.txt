Fix alignment in genome output
refseq blast: change sort only top id and 

2022-0223
Done:
Changed the "16S Refseq" main menu item to "16S rRNA Microbiome"
Refseq Blast:
  Entry Page:
    Put Note at bottom of page.
    Fixed reset button.
    Made default database: 15.22 (position 28)
    Maximum Target Seqs default: 20 (removed 5 and 10 as choices)
  Wait Page:
    Show elapsed time
  Result Page:
    Sorting: original sort is by sequences in file (or textbox)
    Link to sort by query(alpha),bit_score,identity -- they toggle!
    added radio to show original sort.
    Grey box at top: rearranged and removed mystery link to nowhere.
    Added BlasterJS Alignment links (NEW)
    Fixed 'return to data' link for copy.
    In the data table: made the query text wrap so it can be read.
    proper right justify for numerical data.
    Replaced the "View Link" column with two new columns:"Query Sequence" and "Alignment".
      The Alignment link now open the blast output file.
Genome Blast:
  Entry Page:
    Main menu link opens to default: All_genomes
    Created table at top with five rows:
       blast program selection
       blast database selection (adjusts depending on program select)
       annotation (with ncbi as default)
       blast-against: all or single genome.
       genome selection (if single is selected)
    Fixed reset button.
    Maximum Target Seqs default: 100 (removed 5 and 10 as choices)
  Wait Page:
    Show elapsed time
  Results Page:
    Added BlasterJS Alignment links (NEW)
    Fixed the 'bug' that fouled up the alignments formatting

--change from xml to default blast output -and figure out how to parse correctly
  consider: #https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0205286

Refseq Blast Result Page:
-- Query header should show all header -wrap
--HOMD Clone Name can be narrower (just not three lines)
-- View Link - split to: "Query Sequence" and "Alignment" -get rid of icons
-- sort: initial is by entered seq order
     add another choice "back to original order"
     by bit score and identity should be within each seq
     Radios not cbs
-- what to do with grey box?
--WAIT: show elapsed time rather than seqs processed

Genome Blast
--buttons at top (inside to section of box):"nucleic acid","protein" and "other" (three) for blast program
    then ncbi(default)  and prokka
    then "all genomes" and "Select a genome"
-- get rid of link at top to select all vs single genome

Results:
--WAIT:show elapsed time rather than seqs processed

Protein Blast against all genome not working.

For the bar graph colors for the taxa:

Could all the different Streps be different shades of green?  With S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. infantis 
similar shades (because we can't really tell them apart very well with this data anyway) 
and S. salivarius a distinctive shade, and S. parasanguinis a distinctive shade?

Here are the colors we use for microscopy images; it would be great to match these as much as possible:
Corynebacterium: magenta
Fusobacterium: yellow
Leptotrichia: cyan
Haemophilus: orange
Prevotella:  purple (like you have for P. melaninogenica)
Actinomyces and Schaalia:  red
Porphyromonas:  light/medium blue

1-Let's put on the list to figure out why the sums for phylum go as high as 100.9 
-- seems too high for roundoff error.
2-(JMW)Hi Andy,

Floyd and I just talked and the answer to my question below is no, we don't want to consider 
anything with an HMT number to be a species.

We wouldâ€‹ like to be able to add the multiple clades or multiple subspecies together to 
generate abundance numbers for the species listed below.

In the case of Strep oralis, there are actually two levels to add, because some of the 
subspecies have subclades.

The way the database is structured, can we populate the species level with the sum of the 
sub-species or sub-clades?

A question for the team -- 
I was surprised that Streptococcus parasanguinis didn't appear on the top 10 for tongue, 
and it's because it is divided into two subspecies, so for the species rank the abundance 
tables show "no data".
One of the subspecies averages about 3% in tongue and would make the list; the other is 
about 1%.
The same issue will affect Streptococcus oralis; either subspecies dentisani or subspecies 
tigurinus could make the list by itself in dental plaque, and together they certainly would.
Do we want to add the subspecies abundances together to generate species numbers, or should 
we consider anything with an HMT number to be its own species?

This affects 
Streptococcus parasanguinis (clades 411 and 721)
Streptococcus infantis (clades 431 and 638)
Streptococcus cristatus (clades 578 and 886)
Streptococcus oralis (subspecies oralis, dentisani clade 058, dentisani clade 398, tigurinus 
clade 070, tigurinus clade 071)
Fusobacterium nucleatum (subspecies animalis, nucleatum, polymorphum, vincentii)
Limosilactobacillus reuteri (clades 818 and 938)
Peptostreptococcaceae_G-7 [Eubacterium] yurii (subspecies yurii and margaretiae)
===================================
3-From JMW
1: For Eren V1-V3, Eren V3-V5, and Dewhirst, where you currently have Avg (50th percentile abundance), 
Stdev, and Prev, can you add rows for 10th percentile abundance and 90th percentile abundance?

***3. I suggest a bar chart on the page https://node.homd.info/taxa/ecology
 showing 10 bars, one for each of 9 oral sites plus nasal, as a visual that will 
 show the similarities and differences among sites.
Something like figure 1A in Segata et al. 2012 but showing species where they show genera.
https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2012-13-6-r42/figures/1
Let me know if you'd like some help designing such a bar chart.  
The species should be grouped by taxonomy rather than abundance, and with a color scheme 
where related species have a similar color, as in the Segata et al. figure.

  idea: archyeopterix?
  vamps krona js target plot - useful for homd?
  ppangolin?
  
  Fixed: search for 'accolens' in genome table should get 9 rows
  Abundance
  top hits for abundance per subhabitat
  krona graph for each oral habitat?

Fix taxonomy steps
1- replace taxonomy table
   SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0
   update subspecies set subspecies = REPLACE(subspecies, ' ', '_') 
   WHERE `subspecies` like '%[%' or `subspecies` like '%(%'
2- remove all the [] and () taxanames from domain..species that have '_'
3 - load taxonomy and check
4 - change all the [] and () taxnames to underscores
5 re-run update taxonomy script:
    floyd avoorhis$ ../update_homd_taxonomy_byFile.py -i homd_ncbi_blast_all_tophits-KISS.csv -g

Abundance files changes to match db:
   2021-11-05 :: HMT-191:Changed genus from Propionibacterium to Acidipropionibacterium
   2021-11-05 :: HMT-701:Changed genus from Actinomyces to Schaalia  *partial which species

DONE #666 - Corynebacteria Matruchochi -- what is Reference Strain (None, not yet cultivated) for Jessica
     ans - It is type strain
     if status ==named then has 
     otid::2  phylotype
      1,389 Named  use type strain (see 14)
     20 unnamed
     11 lost
     !!     269 Lost [] yet old site has ref strain:  Smibert D15A-4   IMPORTANT not in my db!
---------------------------------     
DONE in Search Result:: put genus species where HMT and SEQF are showing (maybe phage too)
--- Download Abundance data - how & where?

Meeting:
DONE Hide "site" for time being
DONE: Hide all phage pages
Plan for abundance table in DB
Create abundance Table with dewhirst and eren sum up ranks for all abund data => python script
Abundance graph: remove Groups; text to be domain only?? ask jess

blast tblastn got a warning in blasterror.txt
 with no hits found -- should read blast results BEFORE blasterror.txt
ADD Note:  to blast wait: **please do not leave page**
Pull test genome db to home macbook for testing
Ask George: html (genomic) vs json (refseq) and table
-How to download an html output?
Where to add schema - download? put a date on it
Add flag table to db: status,site what others?

2021-11-22
put a notes section on the taxon desc page and in the db
Also a db update page
