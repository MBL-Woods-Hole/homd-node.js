I have a number of issues with the Genome BLAST
   Use this protein as the example:
>hypothetical protein HMPREF0629_01218 [Peptoniphilus sp. oral taxon 386 str. F0131]GenBank: EFI42564.1
MMESRPEFDKITSFDEFTKYYWYREELSQICKSLGLEYRGTKQELNYIIEQYFKGNLIKKSSIKNEKKQVENITLDTPLLECGFSFNAKFREYFTVLTGISPFKFTADMATVWRKVKRENDLSFTIQDMLKVYYGKSDYAKYDNSVCQWNQFLKDFCADENSCNYSNKLKVASILWKEVRNSRNEKIYSKNLLTEYADKIKEYCK
Note: there are 5 100% Ident hits—the first being Bulleidia extructa.
In the Alignments:
·         I find the dark blue highlight makes the information hard to read
·         In the blue box the Number of Matches 1 can be dropped as always 1
·         In the actual alignment, the font must be proportional font Currier New or other.  You don’t see the problem until you have sequences with poor matches, then you see things don’t line up.
·         I would like to change the links above the blue bar to

GenBank  GenBank  HOMD     HOMD   HOMD        Protein
 Entry    Viewer  JBrowse  Taxon  MetaInfo      ID
 
The links for these 6 buttons are

·         https://www.homd.org/genome/genome_description?gid=SEQF1730

·      The protein ID is EFC05543.1 which points to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/283104164 which is equivalent to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/EFC05543 (God knows where they got an absolute protein ref number—it never shows up on any of the pages).  Now the trick for Andy or George is to figure out how get the EFC05543.1 number or link.  It is in the GenBank entry under protein ID.  It is in the JBrowse view that comes up.  Is this number EFC05543.1 stored in any form in any place in the HOMD tables?  Back under Descriptions the Accession is 1282804 which is a link to the GenBank Entry.    I can explain in Zoom why getting this Protein ID in one click is very important during Zoom
As it stands, the links are not descriptive of where you go.  I want them bigger and two lines.
Best,Floyd

JMW would like a custom blast output similar to
blast-script/abundance-sripts/#12
Hi Andy,

What Bernd is trying to do is probably very similar to that BLAST parse script you wrote for me.
  The script is very useful in that it will report not only how many equally good top hits 
  there are, and which taxa, but also the % identity over the entire length of the query, not just the matched portion. 

When you have time, do you think you could make it possible for users to do a BLAST to HOMD 16S rRNA genes and receive the output from your BLAST parse script?

Reguarding loc and highlight::
To prevent loc go beyond beginning and end of a contig,
For beginning it’s easier, just write a conditional if else, if after -500, it’s <1 then it’s 1
For end of a contig, you have to get the contig size, and if after+500 it’s > contig size, then stop is at contig size.

Protein Blast against all genome not working.

For the bar graph colors for the taxa:

Could all the different Streps be different shades of green?  With S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. infantis 
similar shades (because we can't really tell them apart very well with this data anyway) 
and S. salivarius a distinctive shade, and S. parasanguinis a distinctive shade?

Here are the colors we use for microscopy images; it would be great to match these as much as possible:
Corynebacterium: magenta
Fusobacterium: yellow
Leptotrichia: cyan
Haemophilus: orange
Prevotella:  purple (like you have for P. melaninogenica)
Actinomyces and Schaalia:  red
Porphyromonas:  light/medium blue

1-Let's put on the list to figure out why the sums for phylum go as high as 100.9 
-- seems too high for roundoff error.
2-(JMW)Hi Andy,

Floyd and I just talked and the answer to my question below is no, we don't want to consider 
anything with an HMT number to be a species.

We would​ like to be able to add the multiple clades or multiple subspecies together to 
generate abundance numbers for the species listed below.

In the case of Strep oralis, there are actually two levels to add, because some of the 
subspecies have subclades.

The way the database is structured, can we populate the species level with the sum of the 
sub-species or sub-clades?

A question for the team -- 
I was surprised that Streptococcus parasanguinis didn't appear on the top 10 for tongue, 
and it's because it is divided into two subspecies, so for the species rank the abundance 
tables show "no data".
One of the subspecies averages about 3% in tongue and would make the list; the other is 
about 1%.
The same issue will affect Streptococcus oralis; either subspecies dentisani or subspecies 
tigurinus could make the list by itself in dental plaque, and together they certainly would.
Do we want to add the subspecies abundances together to generate species numbers, or should 
we consider anything with an HMT number to be its own species?

This affects 
Streptococcus parasanguinis (clades 411 and 721)
Streptococcus infantis (clades 431 and 638)
Streptococcus cristatus (clades 578 and 886)
Streptococcus oralis (subspecies oralis, dentisani clade 058, dentisani clade 398, tigurinus 
clade 070, tigurinus clade 071)
Fusobacterium nucleatum (subspecies animalis, nucleatum, polymorphum, vincentii)
Limosilactobacillus reuteri (clades 818 and 938)
Peptostreptococcaceae_G-7 [Eubacterium] yurii (subspecies yurii and margaretiae)
===================================
3-From JMW
1: For Eren V1-V3, Eren V3-V5, and Dewhirst, where you currently have Avg (50th percentile abundance), 
Stdev, and Prev, can you add rows for 10th percentile abundance and 90th percentile abundance?

***3. I suggest a bar chart on the page https://node.homd.info/taxa/ecology
 showing 10 bars, one for each of 9 oral sites plus nasal, as a visual that will 
 show the similarities and differences among sites.
Something like figure 1A in Segata et al. 2012 but showing species where they show genera.
https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2012-13-6-r42/figures/1
Let me know if you'd like some help designing such a bar chart.  
The species should be grouped by taxonomy rather than abundance, and with a color scheme 
where related species have a similar color, as in the Segata et al. figure.
