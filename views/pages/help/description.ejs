      The goal of creating the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD) is to provide the scientific community with comprehensive information o足n the approximately 700 prokaryote species that are present in the human oral cavity. Approximately 49% are officially named, 17% unnamed (but cultivated) and 34% are known o足nly as uncultivated phylotypes. The HOMD presents a provisional naming scheme for the currently unnamed species so that strain, clone, and probe data from any laboratory can be directly linked to a stably named reference scheme. The HOMD links sequence data with phenotypic, phylogenetic, clinical, and bibliographic information. Genome sequences for oral bacteria determined as part of this project, the Human Microbiome Project, and other sequencing projects are being added to the HOMD as they become available. Genomes for 315 oral taxa (46% of taxa o足n HOMD) are currently available o足n HOMD. The HOMD site offers easy to use tools for viewing all publically available oral bacterial genomes.
