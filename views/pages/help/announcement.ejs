2020-11-13 - eHOMD has been updated to V9.14
We have added  488 genomes and 3 genomes of which ncbi genbank was deleted from homd which takes Genomic RefSeq version to 9.14. For this update, the version of the 16S rRNA gene reference sequences (16S rRNA RefSeq) is 15.2. Genomic RefSeq 9.14 has 2087 genomic DNA sequences, both finished and draft sequences (2074 Oral Reference Genomes  which belong to 529 taxas and 13 non-oral/non-nasal reference genomes which belong to 13 taxas ) to serve as anchors for the NGS studies.

2018-12-05 - New eHOMD publication!
The eHOMD paper entitled "New insights into human nostril microbiome from the expanded Human Oral Microbiome Database (eHOMD): a resource for species-level identification of microbiome data from the aerodigestive tract" has been published and is available at this link: https://msystems.asm.org/content/3/6/e00187-18. Please cite this paper in your publication if you use the eHOMD database.

2018-03-31 - Change of taxon ID prefix from HOT to HMT
Due to the inclusion of microbial taxa that are found in the human nasal passages, The old taxonomy ID prefix "HOT" (human oral taxon) is no longer valid and has been changed to "HMT" (human microbial taxon) to be more inclusive for the taxa described in the current and future eHOMD. The specific taxon associated with the 3-digit HOT IDs have not been changed. For example, the species Abiotrophia defectiva used to be represented by HOT-389 and now is HMT-389. All new taxa that have been or will be added, will have a unique number that has not been used before.

Abstract

BACKGROUND:
Usefulness of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in assessing bacteria associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has been undermined by inability to classify reads to the species level.

OBJECTIVE:
The purpose of this study was to develop a robust algorithm for species-level classification of NGS reads from oral samples and to pilot test it for profiling bacteria within OSCC tissues.

METHODS:
Bacterial 16S V1-V3 libraries were prepared from three OSCC DNA samples and sequenced using 454's FLX chemistry. High-quality, well-aligned, and non-chimeric reads ≥350 bp were classified using a novel, multi-stage algorithm that involves matching reads to reference sequences in revised versions of the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD), HOMD extended (HOMDEXT), and Greengene Gold (GGG) at alignment coverage and percentage identity ≥98%, followed by assignment to species level based o­n top hit reference sequences. Priority was given to hits in HOMD, then HOMDEXT and finally GGG. Unmatched reads were subject to operational taxonomic unit analysis.

RESULTS:
Nearly, 92.8% of the reads were matched to updated-HOMD 13.2, 1.83% to trusted-HOMDEXT, and 1.36% to modified-GGG. Of all matched reads, 99.6% were classified to species level. A total of 228 species-level taxa were identified, representing 11 phyla; the most abundant were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Thirty-five species-level taxa were detected in all samples. o­n average, Prevotella oris, Neisseria flava, Neisseria flavescens/subflava, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, Aggregatibacter segnis, Streptococcus mitis, and Fusobacterium periodontium were the most abundant. Bacteroides fragilis, a species rarely isolated from the oral cavity, was detected in two samples.

CONCLUSION:
This multi-stage algorithm maximizes the fraction of reads classified to the species level while ensuring reliable classification by giving priority to the human, oral reference set. Applying the algorithm to OSCC samples revealed high diversity. In addition to oral taxa, a number of human, non-oral taxa were also identified, some of which are rarely detected in the oral cavity.

2014-10-07 - Important Notice Regarding Tannerella forsythia (strain 92A2)
Dear Research Community:

I wish to call to your attention an error in the strain attribution for the Tannerella forsythia (previously Bacteroides forsythus) genome sequence NC_016610.1. More than 10 years ago, DNA was prepared at Forsyth by Mark Maiden from strain 92A2 and sent to TIGR for sequencing as part of the initial 11 dental organisms sequenced. The sequence was obtained by TIGR, annotated by Los Alamos, and posted o­n Los Alamos and Forsyth web sites in about 2005. JCVI re-annotated the genome in 2013 as part of the HMP project and released the genome through NCBI in July 2013. Unfortunately, at some point in time, someone assumed that Forsyth strain 92A2 was the same as the Tannerella forsythia (previously Bacteroides forsythus) type strain FDC-338 = ATCC 43037. It is not. More problematic, strain 92A2 was never deposited with ATCC—(we are in the process of doing that currently). In the move from Boston to Cambridge in 2010, Forsyth investigators discarded many old stocks, sadly including 92A2. After many inquiries, I was extremely relieved to find that Gene Leys and Christina Igboin had frozen stocks at Ohio State University. With their help, we now have Tannerella forsythia strain 92A2 growing and save away here at Forsyth again. The strain was chosen for sequencing because it contains a tetracycline transposon which was of interest. Most Tannerella forsythia strains do not have this transposon. I have validated our current 92A2 strain as the TIGR-sequenced strain by obtaining the 16S rRNA sequence, and by sequencing the TraG gene from the Transposon. Both are perfect matches.

A true genome sequence for the type strain (ATCC 43037) has been obtained by Valentin Friedrich, BOKU, Vienna, Austria. I hope to have this annotated genome available o­n HOMD shortly and also deposit it with NCBI. I have also contacted Karen Nelson at JCVI to assist in correcting the strain attribution at NCBI for the TIGR/92A2 genome (only the depositor can make changes).

This strain misattribution has cause significant wasted effort by investigators trying to clone out genes or perform other molecular biology. I apologize to the community for not realizing 92A2 had not been deposited with a culture collection and not picking up the strain attribution problem earlier. The attribution was correct 2005 when Tsute (George) Chen referenced the strain in the following publication and o­n the BROP website:

Chen T, Abbey K, Deng WJ, Cheng MC. The bioinformatics resource for oral pathogens. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005 Jul 1;33(Web Server issue):W734-40. PubMed PMID: 15980574; PubMed Central PMCID: PMC1160122.

It may take some time for strain 92A2 to become available from ATCC. If you urgently need this strain for o­ngoing studies, please contact me and I will send it to you. If you can wait until ATCC has it available, that would be most helpful to my technicians. Please do not pester Gene for the strain, or Valentin for the type genome as they have performed their community service already and I’m willing to be the resource contact person. The Tannerella forsythia entry o­n HOMD has a warning flag about the strain attribution problem, and a correction o­n the strain Sequence Meta Information page, but I cannot edit the incorrect strain information automatically downloaded from NCBI. As additional information becomes available, I will post it o­n HOMD Tannerella forsythia taxon description page. Feel free to contact me.

Best regards,

Floyd

2014-03-21 - The Los Alamos ORALGEN Database Archive
Dear Oral/Dental Research Community:

It is my pleasure to announce to you that the Los Alamos ORALGEN Database has been restored and made available o­nline at http://www.oralgen.org

Many of you may have known that the ORALGEN database had been offline since some time last year. Thanks to Dr. Gang (Gary) Xie at the Los Alamos National Lab for providing the original content of the ORALGEN hard drive, I was able to restore the web service and make this important database available o­nline again to the research community.

Please note that this is an archival copy of the Los Alamos ORALGEN Database. This archival database is provided "as is", thus some links and tools may no longer work due to the changes of web address and server infrastructure. The primary purpose for making this archive available o­nline is for backtracking the citations/links that were published before. This database is no longer being maintained, nor is support provided. Many of the genomic sequences that were annotated by the ORALGEN has been updated and are different. Please visit http://www.homd.org/oralgen for a table listing and comparing these changes.

In addition to the availability of the original ORALGEN database, many researchers have also asked for the information with regards to the counterparts of the genes annotated by LANL ORALGEN, to those currently annotated by NCBI or HOMD. The information is important because many of the LANL ORALGEN annotated gene IDs had been cited in publications. For those genomes with sequences identical to those currently annotated by HOMD, we provide an "ORALGEN" panel in the newly implemented HOMD JBrowse genome viewer (http://www.homd.org/oralgen), so that users can match genes/proteins between HOMD/NCBI and ORALGEN directly in the genome viewer. For those genomes significantly different from the current HOMD/NCBI version, the coordination will be too different to be mapped in the genome viewer. This is especially true for these four genomes: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans HK1651 (currently Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans HK1651), Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum (Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum ATCC 10953), Streptococcus mutans UA159, and Tannerella forsythensis ATCC 43037.

For these genomes, the best way to find the equivalent genes annotated between HOMD/NCBI and ORALGEN is by protein homology. I am also providing the matching results in the The LANL ORALGEN FTP Archive (ftp://www.homd.org/lanl_oralgen). This FTP site contains the text data directly exported from the ORALGEN Database, including all the genomes and the associated information. The exported data are in Excel format and can be direct viewed as spreadsheets. Detail information for this archive is provided in the 00_README.txt file in the FTP site. In each of the folders of those 4 genomes with different sequences, there is an Excel file named "lanl_gene_id_2_ncbi_blastp.csv" or "lanl_gene_id_2_homd_blastp.csv". This table lists the possible counterparts of the ORALGEN genes to those in NCBI, (or HOMD) based o­n the BLASTP search. I hope this could ease some of the frustration that many of the researchers have been facing when they are trying to reconcile the differences between annotations.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any question or concerns.

Sincerely,

George

2010-06-10 - Forsyth Scientists Support The Human Microbiome Project
Scientists from The Forsyth Institute are making a significant contribution to the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), which is seeking to identify and sequence the thousands of species of bacteria that inhabit human body surfaces. Forsyth has provided more oral bacteria to the HMP than any other institution. Genome sequences of these bacteria are being determined in collaboration with the four HMP sequencing centers. These sequences will allow the scientific community to analyze the disease-causing potential of oral microorganisms.

Studying human-bacteria interactions could lead to new ways to monitor human health status and to new methods for preventing or treating oral and systemic human diseases. The Forsyth efforts are supported by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, NIH. The mission of the HMP is to enable comprehensive characterization of the human microbiota and to determine its role in human health and disease.

The Forsyth scientific team includes Dr. Jacques Izard, Dr. Anne Tanner, and Dr. Floyd Dewhirst. According to Dr. Dewhirst, "many of the strains that we have identified, and are making available to the scientific community, are unnamed and previously uncultured species. The availability of these strains will allow scientists worldwide to study them for the first time." "Researchers can now tackle key questions about these bacteria that comprise communities called 'biofilms' and really determine how those bacteria interact with o­ne another and with their human host" said Dr. Jacques Izard.

This work was also supported by other members of the Department of Molecular Genetics at Forsyth including Drs. Tsute Chen and Bruce Paster, and Oxana Baranova, Jessica Blanton, and Jennifer Mathney. A key collaborator was Dr. William Wade, Kings College London, London, UK. The long-term goals of the Forsyth team are to determine the molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis, particularly in oral diseases. Understanding host-pathogen interactions is essential for developing successful interventions and preventive treatments.
