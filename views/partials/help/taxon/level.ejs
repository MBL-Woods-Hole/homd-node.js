The Rank Level Page starts with a simple list of the two domains present in the HOMD.
Bacteria and Archaea along with the Taxon Counts, Genome Counts and 16S rRNA RefSeq Count.

There are eight links across the top: one for each rank (Domain through Subspecies)
Selecting a rank button (ie 'Class') will open a table of all taxonomic names for that 
rank that are in HOMD. In addition to the selected rank there is a additional column of the parent class
(in this case 'phyla'). The counts are displayed at each selected rank. 
If you select species or subspecies you also get links to the taxon descriptions 
pages for that HMT (human microbial taxon).
Each name in the table is also a link to the 'life' page for that name-rank.
