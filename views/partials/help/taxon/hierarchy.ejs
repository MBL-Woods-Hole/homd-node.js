The dynamic taxonomy tree page is a javascript based tree containing all the rank names
and their relation to each other. The information at each node also includes counts of the number of taxa, 
genomes and 16S rRNA refseqs associated with this name-rank pair in HOMD.

<br><br>To navigate the tree you can either double-click on a taxonomic name to open a level or use the 
"Open Next Level" button at the top. The "Open Next Level" button will open all the nodes
at the rank you are currently on while double-clicking on the name will only open the node you are on.
To get to the lowest level (species) you must repeatedly click the "Open Next level" button.

<br><br>At the species level the names become links to the taxon description page.
