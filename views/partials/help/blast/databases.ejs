For Genomes Blast:

Genomic DNA from all HOMD Genomes  
         => Blast against the whole sequences of genomes annotated automatically by HOMD

  2. DNA Sequences of Proteins from all HOMD Genomes

         => Blast against the orfs amino acids of genomes annotated automatically by HOMD

  3. “organism”: Genomic DNA

         => Blast against the whole sequence of "organism"

  4. “organism”: DNA of Annotated Proteins

         => Blast against o­nly orfs amino acids of "organism"
