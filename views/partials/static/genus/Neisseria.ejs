<b>Overview</b>:  Bacteria of the genus <i>Neisseria</i> are abundant in the mouth, making up 
2-10% of the bacteria at most oral sites.  
<br><br><b>Ecological role/importance in health and disease</b>: Several of the 20 species of 
<i>Neisseria</i> in HOMD are common members of the normal oral microflora. 
For example, <i>N. flavescens</i>, <i>N. perflava</i>, and <i>N. subflava</i> are abundant 
on the tongue dorsum and <i>N. elongata</i>, <i>N. mucosa</i>, and <i>N. oralis</i> in dental plaque.  
Other species, such as <i>N. meningitidis</i> and <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i>, are human pathogens 
included in HOMD as reference sequences even though they are not generally detected in the mouth.
