<b>Overview</b>:  The genus <i>Prevotella</i> is species-rich, with 51 species recognized in HOMD.  
Some of these species are found primarily in dental plaque and buccal mucosa, others 
primarily on the tongue, tonsils, hard palate, and throat.
<br><br><b>Ecological role/importance in health and disease</b>: As they are anaerobic, 
dental plaque <i>Prevotella</i> are more abundant in subgingival than supragingival plaque; 
major species include <i>P. oris</i> and <i>P. nigrescens</i>.  On the tongue dorsum, <i>P. melaninogenica</i> 
has both high prevalence and high abundance, and an additional 5 or more <i>Prevotella</i> species 
also have &gt;70% prevalence, making the tongue dorsum <i>Prevotella</i> community both abundant and complex. 
Two species, <i>P. intermedia</i> and <i>P. nigrescens</i>, are considered part of the "orange complex" 
in subgingival plaque marking part of the ecological succession from health toward 
periodontitis (<a href='https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-051X.1998.tb02419.x' target='_blank'>Socransky et al. 1998).
