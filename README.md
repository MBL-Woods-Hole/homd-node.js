HOMD (Human Oral Microbiome Database)  2021

This is a re-write of the php version pre-2015

You can clone this code on your system but you will need a database schema (and data)
to make it fully functional.

There is a github repository called homd-scripts which includes python scripts for creating 
JSON files that this project needs on startup.
